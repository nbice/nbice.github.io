                <p>This may seem like a small project, however building a personal website is not a zero amount of work. I spent more time than I care to admit trying to find a good wordpress template and trying to modify it to suite my style. Ultimately I decided to host this site with GitHub Pages and use basic html and css to build it. I can easily clone the repo and make edits from my local code editor and I can keep a record of how the site has evolved over time.</p>
                <p>While I am a full stack developer, HTML and CSS are not my strong suits. I did use cursor AI to help me quickly setup the basic page structure and styles of the site. I then adjusted them as needed but I think this is a great use case for AI today. Why spend more time than needed building a simple site when I can use AI to help get setup so I can focus my time and energy on more important things?</p>
