                <p>
                    I learned the importance of observability the hard way when I was tasked with debugging a major issue in an application that was not observable.
                    The app was essentially not working at scale but there were no logs, metrics, traces, or errors to
                    help me understand the problem. This was also a problem because the issue was not easily reproducible.
                    This led me to learn more about Datadog and how to use it to make software observable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing to be done was to upgrade Datadog within the application. Datadog was technically
                    running on the app but no useful information was logged and any logs that did show up were not tagged
                    with any information. I upgraded Datadog to the latest version on the application and even got it
                    running in my local environment in docker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next I normalized the logging format in the application to make the logs consistent and informative.
                    Including standard key value pairs such as customer IDs, class names, and error messages allowed me to
                    see how the app was behaving at every step in the request cycle. Adding tags to all of the traces also 
                    allowed me to quickly identify where an issue occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metrics are important here because collecting all of the logs that come through the app is expensive.
                    By utilizing metrics we can see the number of requests and errors at any point in the request cycle
                    without indexing all of the logs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last thing needed to make the app observable was to aggregate the logs and traces in a Datadog
                    dashboard. I used a timeboard to visualize the sampled logs at every step in the request cycle and displayed
                    alongside them the error rates and metrics created from those logs. This has proven to be very valuable
                    in debugging and monitoring issues reported in the app. It has significantly reduced the time it takes
                    to investigate and fix issues.

                    I led a project to create a drag and drop content editor inside of a single page React app. Users could use 
                    the app to select pre-built or custom themes to create content. Inside the editor users could drag and drop
                    predefined blocks of various types. Block types include components such as plain text, two column, image, and button.
                    The purpose is to allow customers to create beautiful content without writing HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is written in React and uses Redux for state management. The drag and drop components were written using
                    a library called dnd-kit. One difficulty we ran into in this project was rendering the drag and drop components
                    on top of a content preview panel. This is where dnd-kit was helpful. It allowed us to render an overlay on top
                    of an iframe. The iframe rendered the preview of the content while the overlay calculated the position of
                    the components the user would drag into the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this was a front-end heavy project, the app was built on top of an existing Ruby on Rails app.
                    There was still plenty of backend work to coordinate with the actions taken on the front-end. I also optimized
                    the amount of data that was loaded at any time to make page loads fast and only return the data necessary
                    for the current view. The load time on some views were reduced from 10 seconds to under 1 second.

                    This may seem like a small project, however building a personal website is not a zero amount of work.
                    I spent more time than I care to admit trying to find a good wordpress template and trying to modify it to suit my style.
                    Ultimately I decided to host this site with GitHub Pages and use basic html and css to build it. I can 
                    easily clone the repo and make edits from my local code editor and I can keep a record of how the site has evolved over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I am a full stack developer, HTML and CSS are not my strong suits. I did use cursor AI to help me 
                    quickly setup the basic page structure and styles of the site. I then adjusted them as needed but I think 
                    this is a great use case for AI today. Why spend more time than needed building a simple site when I 
                    can use AI to help get setup so I can focus my time and energy on more important things?
